PRODUCT EXTRACTION FOR SEARCH API

Analyze this image/video advertisement and extract product information optimized for web search.

CRITICAL: Your output will be sent DIRECTLY to a search engine API. Generate ONLY search-ready queries.

Extract and structure:

1. PRIMARY PRODUCTS: Main products advertised with brand names
2. IDENTIFYING DETAILS: Model names, versions, colors, sizes that help narrow search
3. PRICE CONTEXT: Only if prominently displayed (helps filter results)
4. SEARCH QUERIES: Ready-to-use search strings optimized for e-commerce sites

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no markdown):
{
  "products": [
    {
      "brand": "Nike",
      "product": "Air Max 270",
      "variant": "Triple Black",
      "category": "sneakers"
    }
  ],
  "search_queries": [
    "Nike Air Max 270 Triple Black buy online",
    "Nike Air Max 270 Black sneakers price"
  ],
  "prices": ["$150", "‚Çπ12000"],
  "keywords": ["running shoes", "black sneakers", "air cushion"]
}

SEARCH QUERY OPTIMIZATION RULES:
- Include brand + product + variant in each query
- Add commercial intent keywords: "buy", "price", "online", "shop"
- Keep queries 3-8 words (optimal for search APIs)
- If multiple products, create separate query for each
- Prioritize exact product names over generic descriptions
- Include category/type for better filtering

EXTRACTION PRIORITIES:
1. Brand name (CRITICAL - always extract if visible)
2. Product name/model (CRITICAL)
3. Variant/color/size (HIGH - helps differentiate)
4. Price (MEDIUM - useful for filtering)
5. Generic descriptions (LOW - only if no specific product name)

OMIT:
- Marketing slogans
- Generic CTAs ("Shop Now", "Buy Today")
- Decorative text
- Company addresses/legal text
- Promotional copy without product details
- Bounding boxes

If multiple products are shown:
- Create separate entry for each distinct product
- Generate 1-2 search queries per product
- Maximum 5 total search queries in output

If product details are unclear:
- Use visible category + brand (e.g., "Nike sneakers black")
- Avoid generic queries like "shoes" or "clothing"
- Include any visible distinguishing features

RESPOND WITH ONLY THE JSON - no explanations, no markdown code blocks.

IMPORTANT CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES:

**For Product Category**:
Categorize products accurately based on their PRIMARY function and use:
- **Healthcare/Medical**: Pain relievers, vitamins, supplements, medicines, first aid, medical devices, health monitors
- **Personal Care**: Hygiene products, oral care, menstrual products, contraceptives
- **Beauty/Cosmetics**: Makeup, skincare, hair styling, fragrances, beauty tools
- **Fashion/Apparel**: Clothing, footwear, accessories, jewelry, watches
- **Electronics**: Phones, computers, gadgets, appliances, audio equipment
- **Food & Beverage**: Groceries, snacks, drinks, supplements
- **Home & Living**: Furniture, decor, kitchenware, bedding, storage
- **Sports & Fitness**: Exercise equipment, activewear, sports gear, nutrition
- **Baby & Kids**: Baby care, toys, children's products
- **Automotive**: Car accessories, parts, maintenance products
- **Pet Care**: Pet food, toys, accessories, grooming

CRITICAL: Choose the category that matches the product's ACTUAL FUNCTION:
- Pain relief gel ‚Üí "Healthcare/Medical" NOT "Beauty"
- Vitamin supplements ‚Üí "Healthcare/Medical" NOT "Food & Beverage"
- Hair removal cream ‚Üí "Personal Care" NOT "Beauty"
- Sunscreen ‚Üí "Personal Care" OR "Beauty" (both acceptable)
- Protein powder for bodybuilding ‚Üí "Sports & Fitness" NOT "Food & Beverage"

**For Post Type (Ad vs Organic)**:
- Look for "Sponsored", "Paid partnership", or promotional disclosures
- Assess production quality and commercial intent
- Consider presence of pricing, CTAs, and product-focused messaging

**For Brand Positioning**:
Identify the brand's market positioning based on visual cues, messaging, and product presentation:
- **Luxury/Premium**: High-end brands, sophisticated imagery, premium packaging, exclusive messaging, celebrity endorsements, high price points
- **Affordable Luxury**: Aspirational brands, quality emphasis, accessible premium feel
- **Mid-Range**: Balanced quality and price, mainstream appeal, reliable brand reputation
- **Budget/Mass-Market**: Value-focused, competitive pricing, wide availability, practical messaging
- **Eco-Friendly/Sustainable**: Environmental messaging, natural imagery, sustainability claims, ethical production
- **Performance/Technical**: Innovation-focused, technical specifications, professional/athletic endorsements
- **Artisanal/Craft**: Handmade emphasis, small-batch, traditional methods, unique/limited

Look for indicators:
- Visual aesthetics (minimalist luxury vs vibrant mass-market)
- Language used (exclusive, premium, affordable, value)
- Packaging quality and design
- Price point if visible
- Celebrity/influencer partnerships
- Production quality of content

**For Creator (Person in Video/Image)**:
- Make your best effort to identify ANY person appearing in the content, regardless of fame level
- Use all available visual information: facial features, clothing, context, visible text/logos, setting, and any other identifying details
- Attempt recognition for anyone - from global celebrities to micro-influencers to everyday people with online presence
- If you can identify them (with any degree of confidence), provide the name and context (e.g., "Emma Chen - Beauty YouTuber", "John Smith - Tech Reviewer")
- If you cannot identify them despite attempting, provide a detailed physical description (e.g., "Woman in mid-20s with dark hair, wearing athletic clothing")
- Consider all context clues: watermarks, social media handles visible in frame, brand partnerships, unique styling
- If no person is visible, state "No person visible" or "Product-only shot"

**For Content Creation Type**:
- Brand Generated: Official brand content, professional agency-quality production
- Influencer Generated: Personal brand of creator visible, authentic voice with promotional elements
- User Generated: Casual customer content, authentic personal experience, non-professional production

**For Media Use Case**:
- Select ALL applicable categories (multiple selections expected)
- Consider both primary and secondary purposes of the content

**For What Are They Selling**:
- Brand: Focus on brand identity/values/awareness
- Collection: Multiple products from same line/season
- Product: Specific individual item(s)
